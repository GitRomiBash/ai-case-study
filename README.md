Just before technology started coming about Jeff Bezos, a former Wall Street executive, recognized the potential of the rapidly growing internet and wanted to capitalize on it.

Then established Amazon in 1994 as an online virtual bookstore.

"His wife said she was happy to support him either way, so she couldn't be the deciding factor. What could be? Bezos settled on the idea of 'regret minimization'". "I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, 'Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have,'" explains Bezos. "I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision."

* What field is the company in?

Amazon's main focus is in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, AI and logistics(Customer experience). 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

In the past decade, the online retail industry has witnessed some significant trends that have transformed how people shop. E-commerce and personalization have been among the most prominent ones. With the proliferation of smartphones and internet access, online shopping has become more accessible. Customers can now order anything they desire from the comfort of their homes or on the go. The availability of same-day and next-day delivery options has further contributed to the convenience factor, making online shopping an even more attractive option for modern-day consumers.

Apart from e-commerce, personalization has also been a driving force in the online retail. With the help of sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques, retailers are now able to offer personalized recommendations, product suggestions, and even targeted advertising. This has not only improved the customer experience but has also helped businesses in increasing their sales and revenue.

Another trend that has been gaining popularity in recent years is streaming services. With the rise of platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, more and more people are now consuming their entertainment content online. These services rely heavily on personalization methods and algorithms to offer personalized recommendations, curated playlists, and personalized content.

Digital advertising is yet another trend that has been transforming the advertising industry. With the help of big data and machine learning algorithms, advertisers can now target their audiences more accurately, resulting in better engagement and conversion rates. Personalization has been a key factor in the success of digital advertising and has helped businesses reach their target audience more effectively.

Google's cloud platform and Microsoft's Azure compete in the cloud computing area mainly for storage and data analytics, which are significant areas for businesses that rely on AI.

In addition to generating economic growth and creating job opportunities, Amazon's sustained success has had a significant economic impact on people worldwide.

In February 2024, Amazon managed to reach an unprecedented level of success in the stock market, with its stock price hitting an all-time high. The company's revenue and volume were the primary metrics used to measure its success, indicating that Amazon's business operations were thriving. This achievement stands as a testament to the company's innovative strategies, effective management, and unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional value to its customers.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

One of the most notable aspects of Amazon's success is its unmatched customer loyalty. The company has built a reputation for delivering trustable products, which leads to customers having consistently met their expectations. This has helped Amazon maintain a strong market share and fend off competition from other players in the industry.

In addition to their domestic success, Amazon's international expansion has also contributed to their position as one of the top companies worldwide.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

If I were to suggest new products and services for Amazon, my top priority would be to consider the latest market trends and how Amazon's AI capabilities can be used to leverage them. The idea of a smart home is very interesting, given the wide range of offerings from Amazon and the broad applicability of AI. With Amazon already facilitating their customers' grocery and shopping experiences, it seems logical to integrate a smart home solution - including home security that can work with Alexa - into their services. Amazon can offer home services to a greater degree, including an advanced security system, AI robot assistant/butler, and other amenities. Amazon already has a wide range of trusted technology products and services, so why not continue to push forward and do what they do best? An all-in-one smart home package could become very popular among communities in need, providing customers with a sense of safety and comfort.
 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I strongly believe that the introduction of this specific product or service would bring significant benefits to the company. Offering this product or service can help increase the visibility of the brand, generate familiarity, and capture the attention of potential customers. By doing so, the brand can create a strong connection with their customers by relating to their home - a place where they spend most of their time. This can have a positive impact on the brand's reputation and create new long-term growth opportunities for Amazon through strategic expansion. With the rapid advancement of technology, people want to stay up-to-date with the latest trends, and having an entire smart home system can demonstrate that Amazon is at the forefront of this technology. Overall, introducing this product/service can serve as a significant step towards establishing a stronger foothold in the market and staying ahead of the competition. By offering this, the company can demonstrate its commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction, which can help build trust and loyalty among its customers.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Since amazon is really good with using AI and customer recommendations it can also be integrated with the smart home development. For example alexa can be actively listening and always be like a servent or maid coming up with solutions. A family can be talked and AI already has a grocery list for tonight's dinner. The Amazon smart home could also smart windows which with at the push of a button it go cloudy. A the window glass will hold a gas that is permanently inside so it can fog up the windows to could provide instant privavy and shade. Amazon has many oppurtunities when it comes to an entire smart home system. When a person is in bed and doesnt feel like getting up to turn off the lights they can do it from their phone or even clap a certain amount of times. Amazon could also inegrate a robot smart robot assisant that comes with smart home system package. This smart robot assistant can learn everyhthing about the house and slowly learn the master who own it. It can become an effiecient butler with optional setting like no talking or being able to interact verbally and physically. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The proposed technologies for my solution are designed to provide homeowners with an immersive and integrated experience in their homes. With advanced security features seamlessly integrated throughout the entire home, homeowners can feel safe and secure at all times, without any worries. Additionally, an AI-powered butler/assistant can assist homeowners with various tasks, providing a luxurious and relaxing atmosphere, akin to that of a vacation. Moreover, a smart home package can provide homeowners with greater privacy, convenience, and a futuristic feel in their own living space, making their daily lives more comfortable and enjoyable. These technologies, when combined, can create a truly integrated and hassle-free experience for homeowners.
